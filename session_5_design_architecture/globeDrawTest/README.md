# Mesh, noise and perlin noise Example

Simple example to

* generate swarm of drunkenAnts using antclass (see drunkenAnt class demo code from drunkenAnt Music demo)
* generate the ant points on the surface of the sphere using cartesian co-ordinates 
* draw ants paths on globe surface using sperical to cartesian co-ordinates
* build 3D path through surface points
* render wire frame sphere and path through points
