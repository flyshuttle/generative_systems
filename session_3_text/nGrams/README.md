## nGram generator for text with Markov Chain text generator

* Techniques: text sorting, automatic and generative poetry, interactive story structure
* Ideas: Grammar and variation
* Demo: Markov chain text,

This example parses a body of text and generates ngrams of specified length, it then creates a 2D vector of grams and their following letters 

the system then generates a markov chain text of a specified length from a start gram.

### controls
