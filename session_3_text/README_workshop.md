### Example Parts of Speech
#### Nouns:
 Description:
  A noun is a word that refers to a thing (book), a person (Betty Crocker), an animal (cat), a place (Omaha), a quality (softness), an idea (justice), or an action (yodeling). It's usually a single word, but not always: cake, shoes, school bus, and time and a half are all nouns.
 Examples:
 * book, bottle, sunset, cloud, cat, woman, plant, plate, chair, time, drum, hamburger, joy, luxury
 

#### Verbs:
 Description:
  Verbs are words that show an action (sing), occurrence (develop), or state of being (exist). Almost every sentence requires a verb. The basic form of a verb is known as its infinitive. The forms call, love, break, and go are all infinitives.
 Examples:
 * sing, develop, exist, love, break, go, adapt, bring, care, catch, disagree, hit, involve, paint

#### Adjectives:
 Description:
  Adjectives describe or modify—that is, they limit or restrict the meaning of—nouns and pronouns. They may name qualities of all kinds: huge, red, angry, tremendous, unique, rare, etc.
 Examples:
 * huge, red, angry, tremendous, unique, rare, thin, cold, real, strange, young, far, dark
