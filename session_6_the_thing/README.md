Casey Reas writes software to explore conditional systems as art. Using emergent networks and layered instructions, he has created a unique area of visual experience that builds upon concrete art, conceptual art, experimental animation, and drawing. In 2001, with Ben Fry, he initiated Processing, an open source programming language and environment created for visual artists.  While dynamic, generative software remains his core medium, work in variable media including prints, objects, installations, and performances materialize from his visual systems. Reas has exhibited, screened, and performed his work internationally in galleries and museums around the world including the Whitney, bitforms gallery, Ars Electronica and Transmediale.
